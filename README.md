# Representation-and-Distance-Metrics-Learning
This repository contains performance analysis for Distance Metrics Learning on ```cuhk03``` data set.
The python scripts make use of ```Numba``` open source JIT compiler to translate ```Python``` and ```NumPy``` code into fast machine code to improve computation time. Please ensure you have a GPU graphic card and the latest driver installed. 
Numba package can be installed via Anaconda prompt:
```
conda install numba
conda install cudatoolkit
```
